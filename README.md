24/7 WhatsApp AI Assistant with Live Knowledge from Google Docs

Smart WhatsApp AI Assistant Using Google Docs
Help customers instantly on WhatsApp using a smart AI assistant that reads your company’s internal knowledge from a Google Doc in real time. Built for clubs, restaurants, agencies, or any business where clients ask questions based on a policy, FAQ, or services document.

⚙️ How it works
Users send free-form questions to your WhatsApp Business number (e.g. “What are the gym rules?” or “Are you open today?”)

The bot automatically reads your company’s internal Google Doc (policy, schedule, etc.)

It merges the document content with today’s date and the user’s question to craft a custom AI prompt

The AI (Gemini or ChatGPT) then replies back on WhatsApp using natural, helpful language

All conversations are logged to Google Sheets for reporting or audit

💡Bonus: The AI even understands dates inside the document and compares them to today’s date — e.g. if your document says “Closed May 25 for 30 days,” it will say “We're currently closed until June 24.

🧰 Set up steps
Connect your WhatsApp Cloud API account (Meta)

Add your Google account and grant access to the Doc containing your company info

Choose your AI model (ChatGPT/OpenAI or Gemini)

Paste your document ID into the Google Docs node

Connect your WhatsApp webhook to Meta (only takes 5 minutes)

Done — start receiving and answering customer questions!

📄 Works best with free-tier OpenAI/Gemini, Google Docs, and Meta's Cloud API (no phone required). Everything is modular, extensible, and low-code.

🔄 Customization Tips
Change the Google Doc anytime to update answers — no retraining needed

Add your logo and business name in the AI agent’s “System Prompt”

Add fallback routes like “Escalate to human” if the bot can't help

Clone for multiple brands by duplicating the workflow and swapping in new docs
